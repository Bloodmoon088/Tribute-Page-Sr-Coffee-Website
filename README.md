# Tribute-Page-Sr-Coffee-Website

A responsive web design website to FreeCodeCamp Certification with my own styles and rules. This website is a Tribute Page template. Images have not copyright and the font is from Google Fonts website.

The target of this is publicate my projects to the world to share my knowledge and help some people. Every one can contact me to do a project or to work with any companie. This is a free source and everyone can see it, modificate or whatever you want with this projects.

I'm doing the certificates from FreeCodeCamp.org, a good platform to review and get some certificates to ease find a job as programmer, web developer and other stuff...

Thanks for watching my project
